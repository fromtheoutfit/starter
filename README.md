# Table of Contents

The goal of Starter is to be a starting point for your projects and, as such, there are two types of documentation provided:

* [Documentation specific to the project that you build _on top of_ Starter](https://github.com/fromtheoutfit/starter/tree/master/_docs/project/index.md)
* [Documentation specific to Starter itself](https://github.com/fromtheoutfit/starter/tree/master/_docs/starter/index.md)

The former is, by default, just a simple template for you to eventually update as your project progresses. The latter aims to describe what Starter is, how to install and use it, etc.
