# Starter

The goal of Starter is to be a starting point for your projects and, as such, there are two types of documentation; the first type is, by default, a simple template for you to eventually update as your project progresses:

[Documentation specific to the **project** that you build _on top of_ Starter](https://github.com/fromtheoutfit/starter/tree/master/_docs/project/index.md)

The second type, **which is where you should begin**, aims to describe what Starter is, how to install and use it, etc.:

[Documentation specific to **Starter** itself](https://github.com/fromtheoutfit/starter/tree/master/_docs/starter/index.md)

Starter is developed by the folks at [The Outfit](https://theout.fit/).
