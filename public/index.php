      <h1>Hello!</h1>

      <p>At the very begining of this project, you're probably building static templates that'll eventually be integrated into a dynamic back-end (CMS, Laravel, etc.) Assuming this is true, this very file (/public/index.php) is temporary and will soon be replaced by whatever the dynamic back-end requires. So, instead of building stuff <em>here</em>, consider the following:</p>

      <ol>
        <li>Look at the <a href="/_demos/">demos</a> to see whatâ€™s available</li>
        <li>Build your static templates wherever necessary, based on the dynamic back-end of choice (ask Michael and/or Bren)</li>
        <li>Treat yo' self</li>
      </ol>

    </div>
