      <h1>Hello!</h1>

      <p>At the very begining of this project, you're probably building static templates that'll eventually be integrated into a dynamic back-end (CMS, Laravel, etc.) Assuming this is true, this very file (/public/index.php) is temporary and will soon be replaced by whatever the back-end requires. So, instead of building stuff <em>here</em>, consider the following:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Look at the <a href="/_demos/" class="btn-small">demos</a> to see what modules already exist</li>
        <li>Tweak those modules to fit the project, or create your own; either way, stick your work somewhere new. We tend to use <a href="/_templates/" class="btn-small" style="text-transform:none;">/public/_templates/</a>, <strong>(which isnâ€™t created by default)</strong></li>
        <li>Treat yo' self</li>
      </ul>

    </div>

  </body>
