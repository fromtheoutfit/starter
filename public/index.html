  <h1>Hello!</h1>

  <p>At the very begining of this project, you're probably building static templates that'll eventually be integrated into a dynamic back-end (CMS, Laravel, etc.) Assuming this is true, this very file (/public/index.html) is temporary and it will soon be replaced by whatever the dynamic back-end requires. So, instead of working <em>here</em>, you should go to <a href="/_demos/">/public/_demos/</a> and build your static templates there.</p>

  <p><a href="/_demos/">Go to /_demos/</a></p>
