  <h1>Hello!</h1>

  <p>At the very begining of this project, you're probably building static templates that'll eventually be integrated into a dynamic back-end (CMS, Laravel, etc.) Assuming this is true, this very file (/public/index.html) is temporary and it will soon be replaced by whatever the dynamic back-end requires. So, instead of working <em>here</em>, consider the following:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Look at the <a href="/_demos/">pre-existing demos</a> to see what’s ready to be borrowed</li>
    <li>Build this project’s templates wherever is necessary, based on the dynamic back-end of choice (ask Michael and/or Bren)</li>
  </ol>
  <p><a href="/_demos/"></a></p>
</body>
</html>
