  <h1>Hello!</h1>

  <p>At the very begining of this project, you're probably building static templates that'll eventually be integrated into a dynamic back-end (CMS, Laravel, etc.) Assuming this is true, this very file (/html/index.html) is temporary and it will soon be replaced by whatever the dynamic back-end requires. So, instead of working here, you should head over to /html/_templates/ and build your static templates there.</p>
