Things that need doing in this project:

- figure out some sort of cache-breaking for CSS and make it part of the go-prod
  task
- confirm that the .jshintrc file is being utilized by the hint task
- clean out the /js/ directory
- one last check of h5bp (they just released 5.0.0) to integrate new and shiny
  things
- look at .htaccess, in general, to see where we can use apache tools, etc.
- get a 'demo' page in place

- figure out the various platform's home screen icons vs. web app settings
- set up a cache manifest
- test the appcache functionality and path
- try to get autoprefixer working
- document the gulpfile more indepthly
- i think the whole build:docs thing is overkill...
