So, it's the future and websites are complicated. They're complicated to plan,
they're complicated to build, and it's not easy to ensure they're useful to all
of the people all of the time.

That said, we love a challenge, and this "starter project" aims to make it easy
in two ways:

1. It is thoroughly documented.
When something is optional, there will be documentation explaining why you may
or may not want to use it. You make the decision based on the project's
particular needs, then either keep or delete the associated code/files/etc.

2. It will be updated, often.
As time passes, things change. Developer processes improve, polyfills aren't
needed anymore, design trends go out of fashion, etc. This starter project will
be updated often to ensure it's as helpful as possible and it provides what
clients want.

* Initial Project Setup
********************************************************************************


First: Task Runner Installation
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This starter project uses a task runner to simplify the development process. For
example: Sass will be compiled to css on the fly, web browsers will be refreshed
and synchronized automatically, JavaScript will be checked for code quality, and
so on. This task runner relies on certain things being available on your
computer before they can be of any use to you.

To obtain and use these certain things, you need NodeJS and NPM on your
computer. If you don't have NodeJS and NPM yet, go to this page, choose
your operating system, and follow the associated instructions:
https://github.com/joyent/node/wiki/Installing-Node.js-via-package-manager (If
that URL goes away, http://nodejs.org is good, too.)

Once you have NodeJS and NPM, open up your command line interface, navigate to
this project's root directory, and type in the following command: "sudo npm
install" without the double quotes. Press return, then you'll be prompted for
your computer's password, so type it in and press return. Once a bunch of stuff
is done flying by, you're done. All of the necessary things are now on your
computer.


Second: Set Up Project
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The initial HTML template (/html/_templates/home.html) is chock-full of code and
associated documentation that, if left untouched, is probably not ideal for
every project. When starting a new website, read the comments that start with
"( * OPTIONAL * )" and determine whether or not you need each of the associated
things.
