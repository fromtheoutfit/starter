So, it's the future and websites are complicated. They're complicated to plan,
they're complicated to build, and it's not easy to ensure they're useful to all
of the people all of the time.

That said, we love a challenge, and this "starter project" aims to make it easy
in two ways:

1. It is thoroughly documented.
When something is optional, there will be documentation explaining why you may
or may not want to use it. You make the decision based on the project's
particular needs, then either keep or delete the associated code/files/etc.

2. It will be updated, often.
As time passes, things change. Developer processes improve, polyfills aren't
needed anymore, design trends go out of fashion, etc. This starter project will
be updated often to ensure it's as helpful as possible and it provides what
clients want.

* Initial Project Setup
*******************************************************************************


First: Task Runner Installation
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This starter project uses a task runner to simplify the development process.
For example: Sass will be compiled to css on the fly; JavaScript will be
checked for code quality, then concatenated and minified; web browsers will be
refreshed and synchronized automatically; and so on. This task runner relies on
certain things being available on your computer before they can be of any use
to you.

To obtain and use these certain things, you need NodeJS and NPM on your
computer. To check whether or not you already have NodeJS and NPM, open up your
favorite command line interface and type:
node -v (and press return)
npm -v  (and press return)
If both of those commands respond with version numbers, you've got NodeJS and
NPM. If you don't have them yet, go to http://nodejs.org and do whatever you
must to download and install them. I'd give you exact instructions, but the
process changes often enough to be slightly annoying.

Once you have NodeJS and NPM, open up your command line interface, navigate to
this project's root directory, and type in the following command: "sudo npm
install" without the double quotes. Press return, then you'll be prompted for
your computer's password, so type it in and press return. Once a bunch of stuff
is done flying by, you're done. All of the necessary things are now on your
computer.


Second: Set Up Project
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The initial HTML template (/html/_templates/home.php) is chock-full of code and
associated documentation that, if left untouched, is probably not ideal for
every project. When starting a new project, read the comments that start with
"( * OPTIONAL * )" and determine whether or not you need each of the associated
things.
